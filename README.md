# WhatsApp Stats

With this simple app you will be able to analyze:
- :iphone: The total number of messages sent by each participant
- :date: How many messages were sent in each conversation

- :watch: What time of day you chat the most
- :file_folder: How many of your messages are media 
- :speech_balloon: Who is the conversation starter?
- :memo: Who writes the longest messages on average?


# TO DO:
1. Finish adding new methods to app.py file
2. Evaluate how to extend text_regularization method
3. (?) Implement naive bayes classifier to allow users to input a string and return who the most likylu author of that message is
4. Rewrite test to accomodate the refactor from json to pandas dataframe in analysis class
